# Dialogue_Reader
This python script was developed to aid in the visual output of a Rtasq daily dialogue. The dailogue is a json file and for people who do not read code on a day-to-day basis could have a hard time finding the information relevant to them. The script parses through the [Results] list to find dictionaries 'question', 'questionText', 'answer' and thwir responses in order to convert this information into a csv. I have found pulling the information into a csv is great for visual presentation and is easily understood in comparsion to a JSON file.
